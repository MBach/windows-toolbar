The simplest way to make this plugin to work is to put it in a subdirectory called "plugins" next to the executable.

For example, if "Madame MiamMiam's Music Player" is installed here:
C:\Program Files\Madame MiamMiam's Music Player

so it will be:

C:\Program Files\Madame MiamMiam's Music Player\plugins

And the complete path is:

C:\Program Files\Madame MiamMiam's Music Player\plugins\windows-toolbar.dll

It is possible to know if it's working in "Options\Customize General Options".
You should see a new icon call "Plugins" with at least one plugin.
Its name is "WindowsToolBar", and is automatically loaded.
